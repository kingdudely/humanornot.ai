# How to use

To use, wait until it is your turn then use `setInnerText` (I just rename the function to `set` for accessibility and convenience) and type anything you want in it, like

```javascript
set("Hi!")
```

And you can even do

```javascript
set("<h1>BIG TEXT!</h1>")
```

If you want to load images, just do

```javascript
set('<img src="YOUR DATA URI">')
``` 

Btw **NOT AN IMAGE URL, A DATA URI** (Just search up how to generate one)

When I have the time I will turn this into an extension.
